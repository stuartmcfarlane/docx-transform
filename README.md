# docx-transform

Node stream transform that takes a html stream and produced a Word docx stream

This was initiailly intended to convert an arbitaty stream of html into a stream of MS Word docx.
It turned out in being an excercise in node stream programming. Who's have thought that implementing
a html to docx converter would be more work than copying my CV into a word document and reformatting it.
Go figure...
